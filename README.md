# Introduction
Restaurants are always looking for the next big location to lure in new consumers. In this ever growing city that is slowly becoming a prominent "foodie" city, the idea of this research is to predict where the next booming area will be in Washington, DC. Through this analysis, restaurants will be able to plan on finding the correct area of where they can start their restaurant. This analysis would be useful to restaurant owners, people who want to open restaurants, restaurant suppliers, or even people who want to invest in real estate. Based on data, these stakeholders will find this valuable to invest in locations at a lower cost, and to establish their restuarants earlier than others. We will use Foursquare location data to see the trends over the last 10 years to figure out what variables led to having neighborhoods boom.
